            <p class = "aboutText">Name's Yuusha well not really and I really enjoy playing Video Games.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "aboutText">Started playing games when I was 7 with my Sega Megadrive, which I still have, and grew up on Sega.
                Moved to Playstation in my teens and that's when I discovered the Final Fantasy Series and was instantly hooked.
                I've been playing Final Fantasy ever since as my main series to play. I do branch out occasionally and play other fun games.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "aboutText">It's pretty safe to say I've played most of the Final Fantasy Franchise including the mobile games.
                So what will you see on this channel? Mainly Final Fantasy stuff I plan to do vs. videos of boss battles from various FF games.
                Mainly bosses from the mobile games Brave Exvius and Dissidia every week as events update. Maybe a cinematic series of other
                games I enjoy playing too on the side.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class = "aboutText">Also on the website I'll put some guides about the various games that I play as well.</p>

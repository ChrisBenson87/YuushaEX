        GETTING THINGS DONE
        <br>
        <br>
        So I'm not one for burning myself out when a game comes out straight away I like to take my time with them and fully enjoy them. I'm also not a god gamer
        but like to think of myself as half decent but they are my passion. So this blog post is gonna be about completing stuff that I've missed out and just
        getting things finished in game.

        27-03-2023: BATTLE TO THE BIG BRIDGE
        <br>
        <br>
        Still getting things done in SOPFFO. I finally figured out what I was missing to unlock Wanderer of the Rift had to beat the Warrior of Light again in order
        to get it done. Been enjoying it so far but I ran into a situation where my rift floor remains the same but all my gil and minions are gone not sure if
        anyone else has had this problem or if its intentional. Was wondering if the guy who voiced gilgamesh was the famous autobot Peter Cullen.

        27-03-2023: ENTER THE DARK ELFS
        <br>
        <br>
        Got my Warden to level 50 in ESO and completed the Elsewyre storyline and thoroughly enjoyed it. So I thought what can I do next and decided to level a 
        Nightblade whilst going the the morrowind storyline, since Necrom is coming out in June and we're going back to Morrowind with it. One thing I like
        about ESO is you can level any class in any zone and it'll all be synced to you so you can try out any story at any level. Decided to make a Kajhiti
        Nightblade though after a certain character dear to my heart from Elsewyre.

        27-02-2023: BACK TO CHAOS
        <br>
        <br>
        So this week I decided to go back Stranger of Paradise FF Origins and get things done. I left it off after completing it and have gotten used to it again.
        Now the new DLCs have all come out and its pretty much a year later I'm back at it. Getting stuck in with Bahamut and working my way through unlocking all
        the stuff in Trials of the Dragon King. I did try out the DLCs when they released but unfortunatly you can't unlock Wanderer without first completing
        Bahamut. I always find unlocking stuff is so fun and levelling the jobs.

        My favourite job or weapon to use so far have been the fists and then the Daggers I love the ability Gravedigger, basically doing a sabin suplex.
        My gear is decent having 400 Item level is nice means I can take on older levels with somewhat ease. I'm also putting together some actual builds for my
        playstyle now trying out some different synergys for jobs. I think the Sage has been really good for endgame bosses.

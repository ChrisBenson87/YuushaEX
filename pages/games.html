                PROJECT KINGDOM HEARTS
                <br>
                KINGDOM HEARTS 20th ANNIVERSARY
                <br>
                <br>
                It's Kingdom Hearts 20th Anniversary this year. Hard to believe it came out 20 years ago on the Playstation 2 and I still believe its a seriously
                good RPG that holds up to this day. Its also recently been released on PC on the Epic Game Store with Kingdom Hearts 1.5/2.5, includes a bunch of games,
                Kingdom Hearts 2.85, includes 3 games, and Kingdom Hearts 3, the latest in the series.
                <br>
                <br>
                So to celebrate its 20th I'm planning on doing some special projects for the channel.

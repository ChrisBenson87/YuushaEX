                Strangers of Paradise is a single player, with multiplayer tacked on, Final Fantasy game developed by Team Ninja, the same developer who made 2 other
                FF Games: Dissidia NT and Dissidia Opera Onima. FF Origins is a dark and gritty inspired by Final Fantasy 1 and features the first villain you face
                as the main character you play as.
                
                I like to think that FF Origins as a universal Final Fantasy game even though it has its own characters and story its levels and music are inspired by
                past Final Fantasy Games.

                Gameplay is fast paced and action packed

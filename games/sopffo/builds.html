                In SOPFFO there are many ways to customize Jack with its numerous Jobs and Weapons to the Synergys of each different Job.
                It can be a bit daunting at first but what I find easist is find which weapon you enjoy the most and then find which
                job best suits that weapon and which is the most fun for you. If you just wanna get things done though I've got a few
                starter endgame builds that I find have been the most effective with a bit of my own research as well.

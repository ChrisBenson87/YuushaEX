                Once you've completed the main story you'll unlock Chaos Mode the End Game of Stranger of Paradise: FF Origins. In my experience you can jump
                in straight away and tackle it in fact taking on the more difficult levels unlocks limit breaks for your jobs increasing their max level
                from 30 upto 99.
                <br>
                My advice is try taking on the Chaos shrine challenge LV 300. Get passed the first few goblins and come to the first set of bombs. Soul Shield
                and absorb the Fire cast and fire it back at them till they Self Destruct. From this point of the level mobs drop 290 and higher Gear at difficulty 300
                but doing this trick means a quick easy loot grab. You can do this a few times by heading back to the save point and resetting the mobs. Once you've
                collected a few pieces you can go back to lower difficulty levels and have an easier time.
                <br>
                I recommend unlocking Sage and Liberator first and getting them to 99 close second would be Ninja and Breaker after that whatever you like. Sage is good
                for bosses and when you come up against physical resistant enemies and liberator is good for big packs of enemies as is breaker but liberator is good
                for staying alive.
                <br>
                Right here are some builds to get you started off for Chaos Mode challenge Lv 300. You will see additional stuff that comes from the DLC if you just have
                the base game but the builds can be used without any of the extra stuff.

            <h1 class = buildTitle>SAGE</h1>
            <br>
            <p class = build1Info>
                First up is the Sage. This build is great for tough bosses and clearing out small enemies and ones weak to magic. It allows you to stay back
                out of danger whilst your team mates, if they feel like it, take the attention of the enemy whilst you buff you and your allies whilst dealing damage
                from afar. Your main attack spells will be Quaga or Thundaga whilst buffing yourself with Haste, Protect and Regen. Once you have 3 white and black sigils
                unleash Ultima whilst the boss is focused on your allies to deal mega damage and simple repeat for an easy win.
                <br>
                MASTER POINTS
                <br>
                For spending your Master Points I would go: HP, Break, Intellect, Affinity, Soul Shield HP and MP and for the final four Action Ability Cost -.
                <br>
                COMMAND ABILITIES
                <br>
                <img src = "images/Sage Command Abilities.jpg">
                The Command abilities we'll be using are Magic Regen, Magic Arts and Chaosbringer. Magic Regen is our main ability allows us to keep our MP up whilst casting
                our spells and you can simply soul shield an attack to get your charges back.
                <br>
                SYNERGY
                <img src = "images/Sage Synergy Percentage.jpg">
                <br>
                <img src = "images/Sage Syngery 1.jpg">
                250%: Red Mage gives you Quick Chainspell allowing you to cast your spells at high speed.
                <img src = "images/Sage Syngery 2.jpg">
                250%: Black Mage giving you a bonus to all intellect boosts you have equipped.
                <img src = "images/Sage Syngery 3.jpg">
                250%: Tyrant 
                <img src = "images/Sage Syngery 4.jpg">
                160%: Sage giving you those extra stats. We're not using 250% since we're not bothered about guarding from spells.
                <br>
                So that's the Sage a really fun magic user great for first time Chaos Mode tries.

            <h1 class = buildTitle>LIBERATOR</h1>
            <br>
            <p class = buildInfo>
                Next up is the Liberator. This build is super tanky and can regain health fast thanks to its Heroic Guard and with the setup we're using we can keep our MP
                up and use abilities at the same time. The Liberator can also use any weapon in the game but we're choosing to use the axe simply because of the powerful
                abilitiy Moon Slash we're also coupling the axe charge abilities with the Swordfighter's 250% Syngergy which cuts charge time abilities down.
                <br>
                MASTER POINTS
                For master points I would go HP, Strengh, Stamina, Affinty, Damage Taken at Max HP, Soul Shield HP and MP and for the final four Lightbringer duration.

                It can be quite daunting with 5 years of content and mechanics to catch up on so here's a new player guide with a list of things to do
                and catch up on.
                <br>
                QUESTING
                <br>
                Start off with the story and get some initial characters you'll get a bunch progressing through the story.
                There are 3 acts to go through with Normal and Hard difficulty and can net you a pretty sum of gems. Once you've cleared Act 1, doesn't
                take too long, move onto the Lost Chapters. The good thing about DFFOO is that you can take on past events that had characters
                released with them so you don't miss them. Lost Chapters contains all those events and even dispalys them out as a field, adds
                extra cutscenes and also have Normal and Hard mode giving you even more gems.
                <br>
                Once you've gotten some characters you like or are on banner, will explain these later, work on your summons, which you'll get whilst
                progressing through the story. You can obtain summon levelling materials through the World of Illusions by selecting the summon you
                want to level, earn the materials through the battles, and levelling the summons through the menu. Also run through some crystal
                dungeons in the events section at the bottom to get some crystals to power up your characters.

                Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Onima is a mobile game made my Team Ninja from Square-Enix. Dissidia is a Universal FF game meaning characters from across
                the entire FF series appear. It's also a Gacha game meaning every so often the game will ask you, if you want, to spend some earnable in game currency
                on what they call banners for weapons that belong to characters; earnable just from playing the game. The game also has options to buy extra in game 
                currency but you absoloulty don't have to because I have played this game since Day 1 release and have not spent a dime on it.
                <br>
                DFFOO, which is what i'll be calling this game from now on, is currently undergoing its 5th Anniversary, meaning its been going for 5 years. There are
                two versions Global and Japanese. Global is reffered to the english release, and is usually 6 months behind the Japanese Version. For this 5th Anniversary
                there are a bunch of goodies to obtain and there's a free 11 pull every day. There's also some anniversary events called Dare 2 Win and some new characters
                we got.
                <br>
                I highly recommend picking up DFFOO if your a Final Fantasy fan i'll put in a New Players guide as it can be a bit overwhelming coming into the game fresh.
